# Hello! I'm Sammi! 👋

Hi there — I’m Sammi Hilton, a data analyst that turns raw data into meaningful insights. I love exploring how data can drive smarter decisions, whether that’s through building dashboards, automating data pipelines, or uncovering patterns with statistical analysis and machine learning.

This portfolio showcases projects that highlight my skills in Python, data visualization, modeling, and data cleaning, as well as my experience working with complex datasets. My goal is to keep learning, share what I build, and show how thoughtful analysis can make a real impact.

## 🎓 About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
