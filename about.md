## Background

I am currently pursuing a degree in Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science and will graduate in April 2026. My studies have given me a strong foundation in statistical methods, data analysis, and programming, as well as hands-on experience with tools such as Python, SQL, R, and Power BI.

I became interested in data science because I enjoy uncovering patterns in data and using them to create a story. Some of my projects have included analyzing survey data to understand Net Promoter Score (NPS) trends, building interactive dashboards to track business and marketing performance, and working with large datasets to clean, transform, and visualize insights.

My career goal is to become a data analyst or data scientist, where I can apply my skills in statistics and data science to support data-driven decision-making and create clear, actionable insights for organizations.
