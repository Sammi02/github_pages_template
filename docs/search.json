Some of my projects have included analyzing survey data to understand Net Promoter Score (NPS) trends, building interactive dashboards to track business and marketing performance, and working with large datasets to clean, transform, and visualize insights.\nMy career goal is to become a data analyst or data scientist, where I can apply my skills in statistics and data science to support data-driven decision-making and create clear, actionable insights for organizations."
